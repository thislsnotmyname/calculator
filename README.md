# calculator
This project is to create a calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using all of the ideas taught in the [Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

This project honestly took longer than I expected, but I am glad to know that ~~it is done~~.

UPDATE: The styles are currently broken on Firefox.

This project includes:
- ➕ Basic arithmetic functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division)
- 🔙 Clear and backspace buttons
- . Decimal support
- ⌨ Keyboard support
- 🙅‍♂️ No dividing by 0
